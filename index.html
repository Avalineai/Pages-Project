  <p>The wolf, is also know as the grey/gray wolf or timber wolf, and is a canine native to Eurasia and North America. It is distinguished from its larg size and less pointed features such as ears and muzzle.
  <p>Wolves hunt in packs but typically single wolves or mated pairs have higher success rates. </p>
  <p>Wolves howl to assemble the pack, to pass an alarm, or to locate each other during a storm or in unfamiliar territory. This is their way of communicating across great distances.</p>
